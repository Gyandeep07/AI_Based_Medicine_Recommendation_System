The Problem
The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. Our goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.

The Solution
We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms. Here's how it works:

Symptom Input: Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.
Machine Learning Model: We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model is capable of predicting diseases based on input symptoms.
Prediction: The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users with instant information about potential health concerns.
Additional Information: To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional information about the predicted disease. This includes a description of the disease, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The web app boasts an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring that users can input their symptoms without any hassle.
Accurate Predictions: Leveraging machine learning, our model provides accurate disease predictions based on the symptoms provided by the user.
Comprehensive Information: In addition to predictions, the app offers comprehensive information about the predicted disease, including descriptions, precautions, medications, diet recommendations, and workout tips.
ducational Content: To empower users with knowledge, the app includes informative blog posts about various health topics.
